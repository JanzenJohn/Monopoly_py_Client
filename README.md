Monopoly_py is a Online monopoly Game

The the server source code is currently under development
as it is not possbible to run it through crontab

To test it you can either develop your own server (not recommended)
or message me at work@johnjanzen.me and I will host a server for you

Im working on an always online server so you can test it anytime
